  abstract={Is the cross-sectional distribution of house prices close to a lognormal distribution, as is often assumed in empirical studies on house price indexes? How does the distribution evolve over time? To address these questions, we investigate the cross-sectional distribution of house prices in the Greater Tokyo Area. We find that house prices (Pi) are distributed with much fatter tails than a lognormal distribution and that the tail is quite close to that of a power-law distribution. We also find that house sizes (Si) follow an exponential distribution. These findings imply that size-adjusted house prices, defined by lnPi - aSi, should be normally distributed. We find that this is indeed the case for most of the sample period, but not the bubble era, during which the price distribution has a fat upper tail even after adjusting for size. The bubble was concentrated in particular areas in Tokyo, and this is the source of the fat upper tail.},

abstract = {The main focus of this paper is on the development of a Monte Carlo based method for estimating the reliability of structural systems. The use of Monte Carlo methods for system reliability analysis has several attractive features, the most important being that the failure criterion is usually relatively easy to check almost irrespective of the complexity of the system. The flip side of such methods is the amount of computational efforts that may be involved. However, by reformulating the reliability problem to depend on a parameter and exploiting the regularity of the failure probability as a function of this parameter, it is shown that a substantial reduction of the computational efforts involved can be obtained.}
